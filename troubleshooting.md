# Troubleshooting
## Big Images on NVidia graphics cards
Errors may pop up when processing big images on NVidia cards on Windows (CL_INVALID_COMMAND_QUEUE, CL_INVALID_PROGRAM_EXECUTABLE, CL_MEM_OBJECT_ALLOCATION_FAILURE): The issue is related to a timeout of the operating system interrupting processing on the GPU. Add these keys to the windows registry and restart the machine (warning, don't do this if you're not sure. Ask you IT department for support. [Read the BSD3 license file](license.txt) for details on what why we're not responsible for your actions on your computer ):
```
[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers]
"TdrDelay"=dword:0000003c
"TdrDdiDelay"=dword:0000003c
```
Here is more information about what TDR is: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/tdr-registry-keys

## Big Images on AMD graphics cards
Similar to NVidia drives (see above), issues may appear due to a timeout when processing large images. The issue is related to a timeout of the operating system interrupting processing on the GPU. Add these keys to the windows registry and restart the machine (warning, don't do this if you're not sure. Ask you IT department for support. [Read the BSD3 license file](license.txt) for details on what why we're not responsible for your actions on your computer ). Similar to the solution above, enter a new key in the registry of Windows in this path
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\GraphicsDrivers
```
The key should be called `TdrDelay` and have a value of 8.

## Black images on Intel GPUs / Linux
On an "Intel(R) HD Graphics Kabylake Desktop GT1.5" used from Ubuntu Linux 20.04 it was observed that some operations lead to empty images.
Furthermore, a warning is shown on std err `Beignet: "unable to find good values for local_work_size[i], please provide\n" " local_work_size[] explicitly, you can find good values with\n" " trial-and-error method."`.

This issue can be solved by installing a recent Intel OpenCL ICD, e.g. with this command:
```
sudo apt-get install intel-opencl-icd
```
Furthermore, use the device "Intel HD Graphics Gen 9 NEO".

## Repeated initialisation fails on AMD Vega 10
When creating CLIJ instances and closing them repeatedly, it crashes after about 40 attempts. [This test](https://github.com/clij/clij-core/blob/master/src/test/java/net/haesleinhuepf/clij/test/InitialisationTest.java#L17) allows reproducing the issue on specified hardward. Workaround:
Don't close the CLIJ instance and keep working with the singleton instance.

## MacOS shows login screen after running CLIJ for a while
On some MacOS systems with modern AMD Graphics Cards, CLIJ causes a crash which leads to the operating system restarting the session and logging out the user. 
Reason is an energy saving mode. To solve this problem, turn off "Automatic graphics switching" under "System Preference" > "Energy Saver". 
Thanks to Tanner Fadero for reporting this bug and its [solution](https://forum.image.sc/t/ijm-macro-crashes-after-a-few-loops/40130/16).
## Result image is black or shows random textures
This might happend with older GPUs which have not been tested. A helpful workaround is converting all images to 32 bit using `run("32-bit");` before sending them to the GPU.
## UnsatisfiedLinkError in deconvolution
If `CLIJx_deconvolveRichardsonLucyFFT` outputs a java.lang.UnsatisfiedLinkError as shown [here](https://forum.image.sc/t/clij-deconvolution/35172/83), installation of the [Visual Studio Redist package](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2977003/the-latest-supported-visual-c-downloads) might help. 
## Class not found on Linux
CLIJ doesn't start on Ubuntu linux with an error message that a class called ClearCLBackendJOCL cannot be initialized. Installing 'ocl-icd-opencl-dev' helped here.

## Exceptions on Linux
CLIJ throws various exceptions, like CL_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY on Linux. Try installing an OpenCL-driver such as beignet. On Fedora 27 Linux, this command list helped:

```
sudo yum install ocl-icd-devel
sudo yum install cmake
sudo yum install llvm
sudo yum install llvm-devel
sudo yum install libdrm libdrm-devel
sudo yum install libXext-devel
sudo yum install libXfixes-devel
sudo yum install clang-devel

git clone https://github.com/intel/beignet.git
cd beignet/
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
sudo make install

```
More info can be found on the website of the [beignet project](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/Beignet/).
